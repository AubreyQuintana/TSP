# TSP
Python written nearest neighbor algorithm

This program is a delivery optimization solving the Traveling Salesman Problem using a nearest neighbor algorithm. The data given is package information of 40 packages given in an excel file, which I translated into multiple CSV files and read into the program. Each package has a specific address and deadline that it must be delivered by. There are 3 trucks, but only 2 drivers, implying only 2 trucks can deliver at the same time. The requirement is that all packages must be delivered by their deadline, abiding by all stipulations, and the total mileage of all 3 trucks must be less than 140 miles. 

Notes have been throughout the code to ensure readability.
